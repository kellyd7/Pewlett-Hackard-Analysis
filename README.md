## SUMMARY

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

- There will be 90,398 roles that will need to be filled.
  
  
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?"

- Yes, there are more than enough.
  
  
Two addditional queries/tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming 'silver tsunami" would be:
 
  1. A query that provides the count of retiring titles per department name.
  2. A query that provides the salaries that will no longer need to be paid due to employees retiring.
